    Daisy, Daisy,
    Give me your answer, do!
    I'm half crazy,
    All for the love of you!
    It won't be a stylish marriage,
    I can't afford a carriage,
    But you'll look sweet on the seat
    Of a bicycle built for two!

    "O God, 
    I could be bound in a nutshell, 
    and count myself a king of infinite space â€“ 
    were it not that I have bad dreams."
    - William Shakespeare, Hamlet
